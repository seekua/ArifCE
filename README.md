# ArifCE

**Agents change. Your project should not forget.**

ArifCE is a local-first project intelligence and continuity layer for AI-assisted software development. It keeps context, decisions, failed attempts, evidence, refactoring state, and handoff information with the repository so Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and future agents can continue the same engineering story.

> The repository owns the context. The agent only borrows it.

## Not just memory

ArifCE tracks what the task was, what changed, why it changed, what an agent claims it completed, what evidence supports that claim, what a reviewer found, what remains unfinished, and what the next agent needs to know. Agent statements are claims, not facts; deterministic build, test, Git, and search evidence is preferred.

## V0.1 workflow

```text
arifce init
arifce task create "Fix permission cache race"
arifce checkpoint --summary "Reproduction added"
arifce context "finish the permission cache fix" --budget 16000
arifce claim create "Permission cache race is fixed"
arifce verify CLAIM-0001
arifce handoff
```

Canonical Markdown, YAML, JSON, and JSONL live under `.arifce/`. SQLite is a disposable derived index: deleting `.arifce/index/` and running `arifce rebuild` must preserve project intelligence.

## Architecture

The core separates domain rules, canonical storage and indexing, Git observation, retrieval, verification, refactoring, security, and the CLI. Vendor instruction files are small adapters; they never become the canonical memory store. See [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md), [domain model](docs/architecture/domain-model.md), and [V0.1 specification](docs/SPECIFICATION-v0.1.md).

## Installation and quick start

V0.1 requires the .NET 10 SDK. From source:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run --project src/ArifCE.Cli -- init
```

Run `init` in a new Git repository or `adopt` in an existing one. Both are non-destructive and idempotent. `adopt` records observed structure and labels unknown historical rationale as unknown.

## Continuity, verification, and refactors

- A fresh agent reads `AGENTS.md`, `.arifce/PROTOCOL.md`, and `.arifce/CURRENT.md`, then requests task-specific context instead of bulk-loading history.
- Claims link to repository-scoped evidence. Evidence becomes stale when the relevant repository state changes.
- Refactor campaigns track invariants, inventory, guards, progress, and checkpoints. Blocking guards prevent completion.
- Handoffs summarize current engineering state rather than dumping transcripts.

## Security and limitations

Raw transcripts are untrusted and are never bulk-loaded or executed. Import paths redact common secrets; credentials and machine authentication data do not belong in `.arifce/`. V0.1 does not guarantee correctness, token savings, or better review quality. It has no cloud service, UI, vector database, autonomous swarm, or production cross-agent invocation.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The exact implemented command syntax is documented in the [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli.md).

## License

No final license has been selected yet because that is an owner decision. Candidate permissive licenses are documented in the roadmap.
